# Lymbus

***Currently under development***

Lymbus (combination of 'lyrics' and 'nimbus') is a unique way to look at song lyrics. 

This app converts song lyrics into both a word cloud and a frequency delimited categorized list.

Word cloud is generated using [WordCloud 2](https://github.com/timdream/wordcloud2.js).

*All data is scraped from [azlyrics.com](azlyrics.com). No copyright infringement intended. This is just a personal project to practice, among many other things, scraping data from websites.*

### Run Locally
